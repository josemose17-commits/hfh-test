// Scenario data for the Uma Musume turn coach.
// Compiled from JP and Global guides as of October 2026 (Global after the July 2026
// rebalance). Turns marked "approx." are best-effort; the in-game goal list wins.
//
// Turn numbering: 1-24 Junior, 25-48 Classic, 49-72 Senior, 73-78 finale.
// Each year has 24 turns (Early/Late for each month, starting in January).
//
// caps:      base stat caps [speed, stamina, power, guts, wit]. Inheritance can raise them.
// opening:   the scenario's opening plan (see applyOpening in engine.js): early Wit/bond focus,
//            an opening rest turn, a scenario card to chase once she joins, early Recreation.
// goalRaceEnergy: energy a goal race costs here (Trackblazer's debut); 0 elsewhere.
// gainScale: how big trainings are compared with URA. The coach replaces this with your
//            own numbers once you have entered real gains on a few turns.
// finale.forced: true only where the finale race turns are certain.
// train:     base training values at facility level 1 per facility:
//            [speed, stamina, power, guts, wit, skill points, energy] (GameTora scenario pages).
//            trainApprox marks scenarios whose values aren't published yet (Island values are used).
// inputs:    extra fields. scope "facility" shows on each training, "turn" once per turn.
//            type is "number", "check" or "select" (with options).
